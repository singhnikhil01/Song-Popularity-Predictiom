*   Pandas (likely for data handling)
*   NumPy (likely for numerical operations)

## Installation

To get this project up and running locally, follow these steps. This project is designed to be run in a Jupyter Notebook environment.

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/song-popularity-predictiom.git
    ```
    *(Replace `https://github.com/your-username/song-popularity-predictiom.git` with the actual repository URL)*

2.  Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd song-popularity-predictiom
    ```

3.  Install the necessary dependencies. While no `requirements.txt` was detected, typical dependencies for such a project using Jupyter and Scikit-learn would include:
    ```bash
    pip install jupyter pandas scikit-learn numpy matplotlib seaborn
    ```
    *(Ensure you have Python and pip installed)*

## Usage

The core of this project is the Jupyter Notebook. To run it:

1.  Start the Jupyter Notebook server from the project directory:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```

2.  Your web browser should open a new tab showing the Jupyter Notebook dashboard.

3.  Navigate to and open the `SongpopularityPrediction.ipynb` file.

4.  Execute the cells within the notebook sequentially to run the data loading, processing, model training, and prediction steps.
